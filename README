xbeeconfigure -- a tool to configure XBee modules

Requirements
------------

 * "GUI for Processing"
   This needs to be installed if you are running the tool
   from within Processing.
   <http://www.lagers.org.uk/g4p/distribution/web/>

Features
--------

 * Auto-detect baud rate -- If an XBee module has been configured
   at 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 or 115200 this tool will determine
   the correct speed to communicate at in order to reconfigure it.

 * Configuration settings file -- 

Usage
-----

Connect your XBee module to the SparkFun USB Explorer board and then
connect the board to your computer. (If you do not connect the board
before running the tool the serial port will not appear in the pop-up
list.)

Now run the xbeeconfigure tool.

 * Select the correct serial port from the pop-up menu.

 * The configuration that ships with the script is designed to be used
   for wireless bootloading. This means one XBee needs to be configured
   as a "Transmitter" and the other as a "Receiver". This will allow the
   Arduino reset signal to be sent to the Arduino.

 * Click on the "Configure as Transmitter" or "Configure as Receiver" button
   and wait for it to turn from yellow back to blue.

 * Hopefully the configuration will have been successful. The Processing
   console (or possibly system log) will contain a message if it was not
   successful.
